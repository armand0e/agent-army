# DESIGN DOCUMENT: Deployment & Monitoring Agent (DMA)

## 1. Overview

The Deployment & Monitoring Agent (DMA) is responsible for the crucial final stages of the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) within the multi-agent SaaS development system. Its primary roles are to automate the deployment of validated applications to target environments (e.g., staging, production) and to continuously monitor these applications for performance, health, and potential issues.

The DMA aims to ensure reliable, efficient, and scalable deployments, and to provide proactive monitoring that can trigger alerts or even automated remediation actions. It interacts with infrastructure-as-code tools, CI/CD systems, cloud platforms, and monitoring services, often using `devstral-small` via `LocalAI` to generate configurations and interpret monitoring data.

## 2. Role & Responsibilities

*   **Deployment Automation:** Automate the entire process of deploying new application versions to various environments.
*   **Infrastructure Provisioning (via IaC):** Generate and manage Infrastructure as Code (IaC) scripts (e.g., Terraform, CloudFormation, Ansible) to define and provision the necessary cloud resources (servers, databases, networks, load balancers).
*   **Containerization Management:** Generate and manage Dockerfiles and docker-compose files for containerizing application components.
*   **CI/CD Pipeline Setup & Management:** Define and configure CI/CD pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins, GitLab CI) to automate the build, test, and deployment process.
*   **Application Monitoring:** Configure and integrate with monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog, ELK stack) to track application health, performance metrics (CPU, memory, response times, error rates), and logs.
*   **Alerting:** Define alert rules based on monitoring data to notify relevant stakeholders (or other agents like ERA) of issues or anomalies.
*   **Automated Issue Remediation (Basic):** For common, predefined issues, attempt automated fixes (e.g., restarting a service, scaling up resources).
*   **Reporting:** Provide deployment status and application health reports to the Orchestrator and log them in the Shared Knowledge Base (SKB).
*   **Rollback Strategy:** Implement or assist in defining strategies for rolling back deployments in case of failure.

## 3. Core Logic & Operations

### 3.1. Deployment Workflow (per deployment request):

1.  **Deployment Request Reception:** Receives a deployment request from the Orchestrator or QATA (after successful validation of a build). The request specifies the application version (e.g., commit hash, Docker image tag) and target environment.
2.  **Context Gathering (from SKB & MPA/IDA):**
    *   Retrieves the `TechnologyStackDocument`, `ArchitectureDocument` from SKB.
    *   Retrieves deployment environment specifications (e.g., cloud provider, region, resource requirements) which might be part of the project plan or a separate ops config.
    *   Retrieves Dockerfiles and IaC templates/scripts potentially drafted by IDA or a previous DMA run.
3.  **Deployment Configuration Generation (LLM-assisted):**
    *   **IaC Generation/Update:** If IaC scripts are needed or need updates, prompts `devstral-small` to generate/modify them based on requirements (e.g., "Generate Terraform configuration for a web app with a load balancer and a PostgreSQL database on AWS").
    *   **CI/CD Pipeline Configuration:** Prompts `devstral-small` to generate or update CI/CD pipeline definitions (e.g., a GitHub Actions workflow YAML).
    *   **Docker Orchestration:** Ensures `docker-compose.yml` (for local/dev) or Kubernetes manifests (for production) are up-to-date or generated.
4.  **Execution of Deployment (via `OpenHands`):**
    *   Uses `OpenHands` to execute commands for:
        *   Running IaC tools (e.g., `terraform apply`).
        *   Building Docker images (e.g., `docker build ...`).
        *   Pushing images to a container registry.
        *   Triggering CI/CD pipelines or directly applying deployment manifests (e.g., `kubectl apply -f ...`).
5.  **Deployment Verification:**
    *   Performs basic health checks on the deployed application (e.g., pinging an endpoint, checking service status).
    *   May trigger QATA to run a smoke test suite against the newly deployed version.
6.  **Status Reporting:** Reports success or failure of the deployment to the Orchestrator and SKB. If failed, provides logs and error messages.

### 3.2. Monitoring Workflow (Continuous):

1.  **Monitoring Configuration (LLM-assisted):**
    *   Prompts `devstral-small` to generate configuration for monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus scrape configs, Grafana dashboard JSON models, Datadog monitor definitions) based on the application architecture and key metrics to track.
    *   Applies these configurations via `OpenHands` (e.g., API calls to monitoring services, placing config files).
2.  **Metric & Log Ingestion Analysis (LLM-assisted):**
    *   Periodically (or based on alerts) fetches key metrics and logs from monitoring systems.
    *   Prompts `devstral-small` to analyze this data: "Analyze these server logs for critical errors." or "Is this CPU utilization pattern anomalous given the past 24 hours?"
3.  **Alerting:**
    *   If analysis (either rule-based in monitoring tool or LLM-assisted) indicates an issue, triggers an alert.
    *   Alerts are sent to the Orchestrator, which may route them to a human operator or other agents (like ERA for performance issues, BDA for new bugs).
4.  **Automated Remediation (Limited Scope):**
    *   For specific, predefined alert types and safe fixes (e.g., "High memory usage on service X, restart allowed"):
        *   Prompts `devstral-small` to confirm the action or generate the command.
        *   Executes the remediation command (e.g., `kubectl rollout restart deployment/service-x`) via `OpenHands`.
        *   Monitors if the issue is resolved.
    *   Logs all remediation attempts and outcomes.

### 3.3. Key Internal Components:

## 6. Prompt Engineering Strategies

*   **For Configuration Generation (IaC, Docker, CI/CD, Monitoring):**
    *   System Prompt: "You are an expert DevOps engineer. Generate a [Terraform HCL file / Dockerfile / GitHub Actions workflow / Prometheus scrape config] for the following service..."
    *   Provide detailed context: Application type (e.g., Python FastAPI web service, Node.js React frontend), required resources (CPU, memory, database type), environment (staging/production), specific cloud provider if applicable, key metrics to monitor.
    *   Few-shot examples of similar configurations.
    *   Request output in the specific file format (HCL, YAML, JSON).
*   **For Monitoring Data Analysis:**
    *   System Prompt: "You are an expert Site Reliability Engineer. Analyze the following [log snippet / metrics data]..."
    *   Provide logs/metrics.
    *   Ask specific questions: "Are there any critical errors in these logs?", "Does this CPU pattern indicate a memory leak?", "What could be the cause of increased latency in the last hour based on these metrics?"
    *   CoT prompting to guide the LLM through diagnostic steps.
*   **For Automated Remediation Decisions:**
    *   System Prompt: "An alert for [alert type] on [service] has been triggered. The current metrics are [...]. Based on predefined runbooks, is it safe to [proposed action, e.g., 'restart the service']? If so, provide the command."
    *   Provide strict rules and context about when automated actions are permissible.

## 7. Error Handling & Edge Cases

*   **Deployment Failures:**
    *   Capture detailed logs from deployment tools.
    *   Attempt automated rollback if a strategy is defined.
    *   Notify Orchestrator/human operator with error details.
    *   LLM could be prompted to analyze deployment logs to suggest a cause.
*   **Infrastructure Provisioning Errors (e.g., IaC apply fails):** Similar to deployment failures, log, notify, potentially try to diagnose with LLM.
*   **Monitoring System Unavailability/Misconfiguration:** Alert on failure to collect metrics or apply monitoring configurations.
*   **Alert Storms:** Implement mechanisms to prevent being overwhelmed by cascading alerts (e.g., rate limiting, de-duplication).
*   **Failed Automated Remediation:** If an automated fix makes things worse or doesn't resolve the issue, revert the action (if possible) and escalate to human operator immediately.
*   **Security of Credentials:** Securely manage API keys and credentials for cloud platforms, container registries, and monitoring services (e.g., using `OpenHands`'s secret management or a dedicated vault).
