# DESIGN DOCUMENT: Shared Knowledge Base (SKB)

## 1. Overview and Purpose

The Shared Knowledge Base (SKB) is a critical infrastructure component of the multi-agent SaaS development system. It serves as the centralized repository for all information, data, artifacts, and learned knowledge generated and consumed by the various specialized AI agents. The SKB enables context sharing, collaborative problem-solving, historical analysis, and continuous learning across the entire system, acting as the collective memory and intelligence hub.

Its design is inspired by the principles outlined in Section 6 ("Building the Shared Knowledge Base") of the system's guiding research document, emphasizing robust knowledge representation, layered memory architecture, and the use of semantic technologies.

## 2. Importance in the Multi-Agent System

*   **Contextual Understanding:** Provides agents with the necessary historical and project-specific context to perform their tasks effectively.
*   **Collaboration:** Allows agents to share information and build upon each other's work without requiring direct, complex inter-agent communication for all data exchange.
*   **Consistency:** Ensures all agents operate based on the same underlying information and definitions (e.g., project requirements, architectural decisions).
*   **Learning & Adaptation:** Stores outcomes, feedback, and learned patterns (e.g., from ERA) that can be used to improve agent performance and system strategies over time.
*   **Traceability & Auditability:** Maintains a record of decisions, generated artifacts, and development history.
*   **Reduced Redundancy:** Prevents agents from re-deriving information already discovered or generated by others.

## 3. Knowledge Representation (KR) Strategies

The SKB will employ a hybrid approach to knowledge representation to accommodate diverse types of information, drawing from Section 6.1 of the guiding document:

*   **Structured Data (Relational/Document DB):**
    *   For well-defined entities like `ProjectBriefs`, `TaskDefinitions`, `TestExecutionReports`, `BugReports`, agent metadata, user information.
    *   A PostgreSQL database or a document database like MongoDB could be suitable. This allows for transactional integrity and complex querying on structured fields.
*   **Semantic Data (Vector Database & Knowledge Graph):**
    *   **Vector Database:** To store embeddings of textual content (requirements, design discussions, code comments, documentation, agent conversation logs) for semantic search and similarity-based retrieval. This is crucial for agents to find relevant information even if they don't know the exact keywords. This implements the "Persistent Memory (Long-Term Memory)" concept.
    *   **Knowledge Graph (e.g., Neo4j, or built upon RDF/OWL standards):** To represent entities (projects, features, code modules, agents, bugs, deployment environments) and their complex relationships (depends_on, implemented_by, tested_by, fixed_bug, deployed_to). This aligns with the "Semantic Layer as a Knowledge Graph" concept, providing crucial business and system context.
*   **File/Artifact Storage (e.g., S3, MinIO, or local file system):**
    *   For storing large artifacts like generated source code files (though primary storage is VCS), compiled binaries, Docker images (pointers to registry), UI mockups, detailed logs, and potentially video recordings of E2E tests. The SKB would store metadata and links to these artifacts.
*   **Ontologies:** A formal ontology will be developed to define the concepts, properties, and relationships within the software development domain as handled by the agent system. This will provide a shared vocabulary for agents and structure for the Knowledge Graph, ensuring semantic consistency.

## 4. Proposed Architecture

The SKB will likely be a composite system:

1.  **Core Metadata & Structured Data Store:** A relational (PostgreSQL) or document database (MongoDB) for storing structured metadata about all entities and artifacts. This store will link to data in other stores.
2.  **Vector Database:** (e.g., Weaviate, Pinecone, Milvus, or self-hosted FAISS with a management layer) for storing and querying text embeddings.
3.  **Knowledge Graph Database:** (e.g., Neo4j) for storing and querying relationships between entities.
4.  **Artifact Store:** A distributed file storage solution (like MinIO if self-hosted, or cloud storage like AWS S3) for large files.
5.  **SKB API Layer:** A dedicated API service that provides a unified interface for agents to interact with the different underlying storage mechanisms. This API will handle CRUD operations, semantic search queries, graph queries, and data synchronization between stores if necessary.
6.  **Embedding Service:** A component responsible for generating embeddings for textual data before it's stored in the vector database. This could leverage a sentence-transformer model served via LocalAI or a dedicated embedding model.
7.  **(Future) Semantic Layer Compiler:** As described in the guiding document, a compiler that can translate high-level, business-term requests into executable queries against the various data stores, particularly for complex analytics or insights.

Integration with `ruvnet/claude-code-flow`'s memory bank concepts: `claude-code-flow`'s CRDT-based memory system (SQLite performance, Markdown readability) could be considered for specific aspects, perhaps for agent-specific working memory or for a human-readable log/journal component of the SKB. Its strengths in distributed memory sharing could inform the design of how agents maintain local caches or views of relevant SKB data.

## 5. Key Data Models / Information Types Stored

The SKB will store a wide array of information, including but not limited to:

*   **Project Definition:**
    *   `ProjectBrief` (from UIBA)
    *   User interaction logs (dialogue history from UIBA)
*   **Design & Planning Artifacts (from MPA, IDA):**
    *   `TechnologyStackDocument`
    *   `ArchitectureDocument` (textual descriptions, links to diagrams)
    *   `APISpecification` (OpenAPI JSON/YAML)
    *   `TaskList` (decomposed tasks for agents)
    *   `DataSchemaDefinition`
    *   `IntegrationDesignDocument`, `DataFlowDiagrams`
*   **Code & Development Artifacts:**
    *   Pointers to code in Version Control System (commit hashes, branches, tags).
    *   Generated `Dockerfiles`, `docker-compose.yml`, IaC scripts.
    *   CI/CD pipeline configurations.
    *   (Potentially) Static analysis reports.
*   **Quality Assurance Artifacts (from QATA):**
    *   `TestPlanDocument`
    *   `TestCaseCollection` / `TestScriptFiles` (or pointers to them in VCS)
    *   `TestExecutionReport`
    *   `BugReport` (linked to code versions and tests)
*   **Deployment & Operations Artifacts (from DMA):**
    *   `DeploymentReceipt`
    *   Monitoring configurations.
    *   `AlertNotification` logs.
    *   `RemediationLog`.
    *   Application performance metrics summaries.
*   **Agent & System Data:**
    *   Agent configurations and policies.
    *   Agent performance logs (task success rates, execution times).
    *   `RefinementPolicies` and `ImprovementReport` (from ERA).
    *   Learned knowledge (e.g., common bug patterns, effective prompt templates, successful architectural choices).
*   **Ontology Definitions:** The concepts and relationships governing the domain.

## 6. API for Interaction (`SKBClient`)

A Python client library (`SKBClient`) will provide methods for agents to interact with the SKB API. This API should support:

*   **Document Storage & Retrieval (CRUD for structured/semi-structured data):**
    *   `store_document(document_id: str, document_data: Dict, document_type: str, metadata: Optional[Dict])`
    *   `get_document(document_id: str) -> Optional[Dict]`
    *   `update_document(document_id: str, updated_data: Dict)`
    *   `delete_document(document_id: str)`
    *   `query_documents(document_type: str, filter_criteria: Dict) -> List[Dict]`
*   **Text Embedding & Semantic Search:**
    *   `store_text_for_semantic_search(text_id: str, text_content: str, text_metadata: Dict)`
    *   `semantic_search(query_text: str, top_k: int, filter_metadata: Optional[Dict]) -> List[SearchResult(id, content, score, metadata)]`
*   **Knowledge Graph Operations:**
    *   `add_node(node_id: str, node_type: str, properties: Dict)`
    *   `add_relationship(source_node_id: str, target_node_id: str, relationship_type: str, properties: Optional[Dict])`
    *   `query_graph(cypher_query: str) -> List[Dict]` (if using Neo4j or similar)
    *   `get_related_nodes(node_id: str, relationship_type: Optional[str], direction: Optional[str]) -> List[Node]`
*   **Artifact Management:**
    *   `upload_artifact(file_path: str, artifact_metadata: Dict) -> str` (returns artifact URL/ID)
    *   `get_artifact_url(artifact_id: str) -> Optional[str]`
*   **Version History:** (Implicitly or explicitly) access to previous versions of documents or artifacts.

## 7. Security and Access Control

*   **Authentication:** Agents must authenticate with the SKB API (e.g., token-based).
*   **Authorization:** Role-based access control (RBAC) to define which agents can read, write, or modify specific types of information or artifacts. For example, only QATA might be able to write final `TestExecutionReports`.
*   **Data Encryption:** Sensitive data stored in the SKB should be encrypted at rest and in transit.
*   **Audit Trails:** Log all interactions with the SKB for auditability and debugging.

## 8. Scalability and Maintenance

*   **Scalability:** The chosen database technologies (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Vector DBs, Graph DBs, Artifact Stores) should be scalable independently based on load. The SKB API layer should be designed to be horizontally scalable.
*   **Data Backup & Recovery:** Implement regular backup and disaster recovery procedures.
*   **Schema Evolution:** Plan for how the ontology and structured data schemas will evolve as the system and its understanding of the domain grow.
*   **Data Archival/Purging:** Policies for archiving or purging old/irrelevant data (e.g., very old logs, intermediate unsuccessful agent attempts).

## 9. Dependencies

*   **Internal:**
    *   All agents: As consumers and producers of information.
    *   Orchestrator: For managing access and potentially triggering SKB maintenance tasks.
    *   Embedding Service (if separate from SKB API).
*   **External/Infrastructure:**
    *   Selected database technologies (PostgreSQL/MongoDB, Vector DB, Graph DB).
    *   Artifact storage solution (MinIO, S3).
    *   Compute resources for hosting the SKB API and databases.
    *   Python libraries for database clients, API interaction (e.g., `psycopg2`, `pymongo`, vector DB clients).

## 10. Future Considerations

*   **Advanced Reasoning over Knowledge Graph:** Implementing more sophisticated reasoning capabilities (e.g., OWL reasoners) on top of the knowledge graph.
*   **Automated Knowledge Discovery:** Agents that proactively mine the SKB to discover new patterns, relationships, or insights.
*   **Federated Knowledge Base:** For very large systems or multi-tenant deployments, exploring options for federating knowledge across multiple SKB instances.
*   **Natural Language Querying of SKB:** Allowing human administrators or even agents to query the SKB using natural language, translated by an LLM into formal SKB API queries.

This design document provides a blueprint for the Shared Knowledge Base, a cornerstone of the agentic SaaS factory.
